    "LifeTel Telecom is the latest entrant in the highly competitive Telecom market of Singapore.  It issues SIM to the verified users.  Till now verification was manual through the photocopy of approved id card document. However, government has recently introduced Social ID called Reference ID which is mapped to fingerprint of user. LifeTel should now verify user against the fingerprint and Reference ID \n",

    "Build a system where when user enters Reference ID it is encrypted, so that hackers cannot view the mapping of Reference ID and finger print Considerations System should be secure \n",

    "Approach to Solve \n",
    "1. Read the input from command line – Reference ID \n",
    "2. Check for validity – it should be 12 digits and allows on number and alphabet\n",
    "3. Encrypt the Reference ID and print it for reference "
